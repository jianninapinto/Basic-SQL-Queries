# Code-Along 10.1 - Basic SQL Queries

In order to set up and run this project, please complete the following steps:

1) Clone the Repository

`git clone git@github.com:bloominstituteoftechnology/basic_sql_queries.git`

2) Activate the Virtual environment

`pipenv shell`

3) Execute the queries in `queries.py` against the `chinook.db` SQLite database by running `connect.py` from the command line

`python connect.py`

You should see the questions and their corresponding answers printed out to the command line.

Below is a Schema Diagram that will aid you in understanding structure of the database.

## Optional

You may also download the desktop software DB Browser to assist you in drafting successful queries. DB Browser provides better insight into table schemas and gives better syntax highlighting for queries than `.py` files.
